His contented mind in all things, his cheerful\ncountenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for\nthe least, without any noise or clamour. Moreover how all acclamations\nand flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he observed all things\nnecessary to the government, and kept an account of the common expenses,\nand how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this\nhis strict and rigid kind of dealing. How he was neither a superstitious\nworshipper of the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of\npopular applause; but sober in all things, and everywhere observant of\nthat which was fitting; no affecter of novelties: in those things which\nconduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty whereof his fortune\ndid afford him,) without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom and\nliberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or\naffectation when they were present; so when absent, he found no want\nof them. Moreover, that he was never commended by any man, as either a\nlearned acute man, or an obsequious officious man, or a fine orator; but\nas a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to\nbe flattered; able to govern both himself and others. Moreover, how much\nhe did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those that were\nnot so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but\nnever unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure,\nnot as one that desired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and\nelegancy; and yet not as one that did not regard it: so that through his\nown care and providence, he seldom needed any inward physic, or outward\napplications: but especially how ingeniously he would yield to any that\nhad obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the knowledge\nof the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred\nwith them, in his best care and endeavour that every one of them might\nin his kind, for that wherein he excelled, be regarded and esteemed: and\nalthough he did all things carefully after the ancient customs of his\nforefathers, yet even of this was he not desirous that men should take\nnotice, that he did imitate ancient customs. Again, how he was not\neasily moved and tossed up and down, but loved to be constant, both in\nthe same places and businesses; and how after his great fits of headache\nhe would return fresh and vigorous to his wonted affairs. Again, that\nsecrets he neither had many, nor often, and such only as concerned\npublic matters: his discretion and moderation, in exhibiting of the\npublic sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people: in\npublic buildings. congiaries, and the like. In all these things,\nhaving a respect unto men only as men, and to the equity of the things\nthemselves, and not unto the glory that might follow. Never wont to\nuse the baths at unseasonable hours; no builder; never curious, or\nsolicitous, either about his meat, or about the workmanship, or colour\nof his clothes, or about anything that belonged to external beauty.\nIn all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and\nincivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with\nsuch earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that\nhe did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at\nleisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably. A man might\nhave applied that to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he knew\nhow to want, and to enjoy those things, in the want whereof, most men\nshow themselves weak; and in the fruition, intemperate: but to hold out\nfirm and constant, and to keep within the compass of true moderation and\nsobriety in either estate, is proper to a man, who hath a perfect and\ninvincible soul; such as he showed himself in the sickness of Maximus."

That I have had such a brother, who by his own\nexample might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and\nlove, delight and please me.

That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long.\nThat I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards\nwhen I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been\noften displeased with Rusticus, I never did him anything for which\nafterwards I had occasion to repent. That it being so that my mother was\nto die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. That as often\nas I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or\nfallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers\nthat there was not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never\nhad occasion to require the like succour from any other. That I have\nsuch a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous. That I had choice of\nfit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children.\nThat by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in\nparticular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness,\nas that also that happened to thee in Cajeta, as unto Chryses when he\nprayed by the seashore. And when I did first apply myself to philosophy,\nthat I did not fall into the hands of some sophists, or spent my time\neither in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers, nor in\npractising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor dwelt\nupon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities. All\nthese things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not\nhave been."

And as for\nthy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and\nunderstanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own\npower, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently,\nor whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether\nindifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto\nconcerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and\nreputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou\ndost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are\nforgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will\nfollow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy\nand variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of\nthe place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth\nis but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very\nlittle part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of\nmen are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou\noften put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little\npart of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction,\nand intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things,\nas a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is\nto be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among\nother things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw\nthyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that\nthe things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand\nwithout still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is\nwithin, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next,\nthat all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little\nwhile be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many\nchanges and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an\neyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life,\nopinion."

For the nature of the universe,\nhaving made all reasonable creatures one for another, to the end that\nthey should do one another good; more or less according to the several\npersons and occasions but in nowise hurt one another: it is manifest\nthat he that doth transgress against this her will, is guilty of impiety\ntowards the most ancient and venerable of all the deities. For the\nnature of the universe, is the nature the common parent of all, and\ntherefore piously to be observed of all things that are, and that which\nnow is, to whatsoever first was, and gave it its being, hath relation\nof blood and kindred. She is also called truth and is the first cause\nof all truths. He therefore that willingly and wittingly doth lie, is\nimpious in that he doth receive, and so commit injustice: but he that\nagainst his will, in that he disagreeth from the nature of the universe,\nand in that striving with the nature of the world he doth in his\nparticular, violate the general order of the world. For he doth no\nbetter than strive and war against it, who contrary to his own nature\napplieth himself to that which is contrary to truth. For nature had\nbefore furnished him with instincts and opportunities sufficient for the\nattainment of it; which he having hitherto neglected, is not now able\nto discern that which is false from that which is true. He also that\npursues after pleasures, as that which is truly good and flies from\npains, as that which is truly evil: is impious. For such a one must of\nnecessity oftentimes accuse that common nature, as distributing many\nthings both unto the evil, and unto the good, not according to the\ndeserts of either: as unto the bad oftentimes pleasures, and the causes\nof pleasures; so unto the good, pains, and the occasions of pains.\nAgain, he that feareth pains and crosses in this world, feareth some of\nthose things which some time or other must needs happen in the world.\nAnd that we have already showed to be impious. And he that pursueth\nafter pleasures, will not spare, to compass his desires, to do that\nwhich is unjust, and that is manifestly impious. Now those things which\nunto nature are equally indifferent (for she had not created both, both\npain and pleasure, if both had not been unto her equally indifferent):\nthey that will live according to nature, must in those things (as being\nof the same mind and disposition that she is) be as equally indifferent.\nWhosoever therefore in either matter of pleasure and pain; death and\nlife; honour and dishonour, (which things nature in the administration\nof the world, indifferently doth make use of), is not as indifferent,\nit is apparent that he is impious. When I say that common nature\ndoth indifferently make use of them, my meaning is, that they happen\nindifferently in the ordinary course of things, which by a necessary\nconsequence, whether as principal or accessory, come to pass in the\nworld, according to that first and ancient deliberation of Providence,\nby which she from some certain beginning, did resolve upon the creation\nof such a world, conceiving then in her womb as it were some certain\nrational generative seeds and faculties of things future, whether\nsubjects, changes, successions; both such and such, and just so many."

Now whatsoever partakes of some common thing,\nnaturally affects and inclines unto that whereof it is part, being of\none kind and nature with it. Whatsoever is earthly, presseth downwards\nto the common earth. Whatsoever is liquid, would flow together. And\nwhatsoever is airy, would be together likewise. So that without some\nobstacle, and some kind of violence, they cannot well be kept asunder.\nWhatsoever is fiery, doth not only by reason of the elementary fire tend\nupwards; but here also is so ready to join, and to burn together, that\nwhatsoever doth want sufficient moisture to make resistance, is easily\nset on fire. Whatsoever therefore is partaker of that reasonable common\nnature, naturally doth as much and more long after his own kind. For by\nhow much in its own nature it excels all other things, by so much more\nis it desirous to be joined and united unto that, which is of its own\nnature. As for unreasonable creatures then, they had not long been, but\npresently begun among them swarms, and flocks, and broods of young ones,\nand a kind of mutual love and affection. For though but unreasonable,\nyet a kind of soul these had, and therefore was that natural desire of\nunion more strong and intense in them, as in creatures of a more\nexcellent nature, than either in plants, or stones, or trees. But among\nreasonable creatures, begun commonwealths, friendships, families, public\nmeetings, and even in their wars, conventions, and truces. Now among\nthem that were yet of a more excellent nature, as the stars and planets,\nthough by their nature far distant one from another, yet even among them\nbegan some mutual correspondency and unity. So proper is it to\nexcellency in a high degree to affect unity, as that even in things so\nfar distant, it could operate unto a mutual sympathy. But now behold,\nwhat is now come to pass. Those creatures that are reasonable, are now\nthe only creatures that have forgotten their natural affection and\ninclination of one towards another. Among them alone of all other things\nthat are of one kind, there is not to be found a general disposition to\nflow together. But though they fly from nature, yet are they stopt in\ntheir course, and apprehended. Do they what they can, nature doth\nprevail. And so shalt thou confess, if thou dost observe it.

For this one, (thou\nmust think) whosoever he be, is one of those impudent ones, that\nthe world cannot be without.

This also\nthou shalt find of very good use, upon every such occasion, presently\nto consider with thyself, what proper virtue nature hath furnished man\nwith, against such a vice, or to encounter with a disposition vicious\nin this kind. As for example, against the unthankful, it hath given\ngoodness and meekness, as an antidote, and so against another vicious\nin another kind some other peculiar faculty. And generally, is it not\nin thy power to instruct him better, that is in an error? For whosoever\nsinneth, doth in that decline from his purposed end, and is certainly\ndeceived, And again, what art thou the worse for his sin?

And what a matter of\neither grief or wonder is this, if he that is unlearned, do the deeds of\none that is unlearned? Should not thou rather blame thyself, who, when\nupon very good grounds of reason, thou mightst have thought it very\nprobable, that such a thing would by such a one be committed, didst not\nonly not foresee it, but moreover dost wonder at it, that such a thing\nshould be. But then especially, when thou dost find fault with either an\nunthankful, or a false man, must thou reflect upon thyself. For without\nall question, thou thyself art much in fault, if either of one that were\nof such a disposition, thou didst expect that he should be true unto\nthee: or when unto any thou didst a good turn, thou didst not there\nbound thy thoughts, as one that had obtained his end; nor didst not\nthink that from the action itself thou hadst received a full reward of\nthe good that thou hadst done. For what wouldst thou have more? Unto him\nthat is a man, thou hast done a good turn: doth not that suffice thee?\nWhat thy nature required, that hast thou done. Must thou be rewarded for\nit? As if either the eye for that it seeth, or the feet that they go,\nshould require satisfaction. For as these being by nature appointed for\nsuch an use, can challenge no more, than that they may work according\nto their natural constitution: so man being born to do good unto others\nwhensoever he doth a real good unto any by helping them out of error; or\nthough but in middle things, as in matter of wealth, life, preferment,\nand the like, doth help to further their desires he doth that for which\nhe was made, and therefore can require no more."

But here contrariwise, man (if\nhe make that good use of them that he should) is rather the better\nand the more praiseworthy for any of those kind of hindrances, than\notherwise. But generally remember that nothing can hurt a natural\ncitizen, that is not hurtful unto the city itself, nor anything hurt\nthe city, that is not hurtful unto the law itself.

From\njustice all other virtues have their existence. For justice cannot be\npreserved, if either we settle our minds and affections upon worldly\nthings; or be apt to be deceived, or rash, and inconstant."

Of everything thou must consider from whence it came, of what\nthings it doth consist, and into what it will be changed: what will be\nthe nature of it, or what it will be like unto when it is changed; and\nthat it can suffer no hurt by this change. And as for other men's either\nfoolishness or wickedness, that it may not trouble and grieve thee;\nfirst generally thus; What reference have I unto these? and that we are\nall born for one another's good: then more particularly after another\nconsideration; as a ram is first in a flock of sheep, and a bull in a\nherd of cattle, so am I born to rule over them. Begin yet higher, even\nfrom this: if atoms be not the beginning of all things, than which to\nbelieve nothing can be more absurd, then must we needs grant that there\nis a nature, that doth govern the universe. If such a nature, then are\nall worse things made for the better's sake; and all better for one\nanother's sake. Secondly, what manner of men they be, at board, and upon\ntheir beds, and so forth. But above all things, how they are forced by\ntheir opinions that they hold, to do what they do; and even those things\nthat they do, with what pride and self-conceit they do them. Thirdly,\nthat if they do these things rightly, thou hast no reason to be grieved.\nBut if not rightly, it must needs be that they do them against their\nwills, and through mere ignorance. For as, according to Plato's opinion,\nno soul doth willingly err, so by consequent neither doth it anything\notherwise than it ought, but against her will. Therefore are they\ngrieved, whensoever they hear themselves charged, either of injustice,\nor unconscionableness, or covetousness, or in general, of any injurious\nkind of dealing towards their neighbours. Fourthly, that thou thyself\ndoest transgress in many things, and art even such another as they are.\nAnd though perchance thou doest forbear the very act of some sins, yet\nhast thou in thyself an habitual disposition to them, but that either\nthrough fear, or vainglory, or some such other ambitious foolish\nrespect, thou art restrained. Fifthly, that whether they have sinned or\nno, thou doest not understand perfectly. For many things are done by\nway of discreet policy; and generally a man must know many things\nfirst, before he be able truly and judiciously to judge of another\nman's action. Sixthly, that whensoever thou doest take on grievously, or\nmakest great woe, little doest thou remember then that a man's life is\nbut for a moment of time, and that within a while we shall all be in our\ngraves. Seventhly, that it is not the sins and transgressions themselves\nthat trouble us properly; for they have their existence in their\nminds and understandings only, that commit them; but our own opinions\nconcerning those sins. Remove then, and be content to part with that\nconceit of thine, that it is a grievous thing, and thou hast removed\nthine anger. But how should I remove it? How? reasoning with thyself\nthat it is not shameful. For if that which is shameful, be not the only\ntrue evil that is, thou also wilt be driven whilest thou doest follow\nthe common instinct of nature, to avoid that which is evil, to commit\nmany unjust things, and to become a thief, and anything, that will\nmake to the attainment of thy intended worldly ends. Eighthly, how many\nthings may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of anger and grief;\nfar more grievous in themselves, than those very things which we are so\ngrieved or angry for. Ninthly, that meekness is a thing unconquerable,\nif it be true and natural, and not affected or hypocritical. For how\nshall even the most fierce and malicious that thou shalt conceive, be\nable to hold on against thee, if thou shalt still continue meek and\nloving unto him; and that even at that time, when he is about to do\nthee wrong, thou shalt be well disposed, and in good temper, with all\nmeekness to teach him, and to instruct him better? As for example; My\nson, we were not born for this, to hurt and annoy one another; it will\nbe thy hurt not mine, my son: and so to show him forcibly and fully,\nthat it is so in very deed: and that neither bees do it one to another,\nnor any other creatures that are naturally sociable. But this thou must\ndo, not scoffingly, not by way of exprobation, but tenderly without\nany harshness of words. Neither must thou do it by way of exercise, or\nostentation, that they that are by and hear thee, may admire thee: but\nso always that nobody be privy to it, but himself alone: yea, though\nthere be more present at the same time. These nine particular heads, as\nso many gifts from the Muses, see that thou remember well: and begin one\nday, whilest thou art yet alive, to be a man indeed. But on the other\nside thou must take heed, as much to flatter them, as to be angry with\nthem: for both are equally uncharitable, and equally hurtful. And in thy\npassions, take it presently to thy consideration, that to be angry is\nnot the part of a man, but that to be meek and gentle, as it savours of\nmore humanity, so of more manhood. That in this, there is strength\nand nerves, or vigour and fortitude: whereof anger and indignation is\naltogether void. For the nearer everything is unto unpassionateness,\nthe nearer it is unto power. And as grief doth proceed from weakness,\nso doth anger. For both, both he that is angry and that grieveth, have\nreceived a wound, and cowardly have as it were yielded themselves unto\ntheir affections. If thou wilt have a tenth also, receive this tenth\ngift from Hercules the guide and leader of the Muses: that is a mad\nman's part, to look that there should be no wicked men in the world,\nbecause it is impossible. Now for a man to brook well enough, that there\nshould be wicked men in the world, but not to endure that any\nshould transgress against himself, is against all equity, and indeed\ntyrannical."

Or should it be so, that the light of a candle\nindeed is still bright and lightsome until it be put out: and should\ntruth, and righteousness, and temperance cease to shine in thee whilest\nthou thyself hast any being?"

Neither can he that\nis the author of that operation; for this very respect, because his\noperation is at an end, be said to suffer any evil. Likewise then,\nneither can the whole body of all our actions (which is our life) if in\ntime it cease, be said to suffer any evil for this very reason, because\nit is at an end; nor he truly be said to have been ill affected, that\ndid put a period to this series of actions. Now this time or certain\nperiod, depends of the determination of nature: sometimes of particular\nnature, as when a man dieth old; but of nature in general, however; the\nparts whereof thus changing one after another, the whole world still\ncontinues fresh and new. Now that is ever best and most seasonable,\nwhich is for the good of the whole. Thus it appears that death of\nitself can neither be hurtful to any in particular, because it is not a\nshameful thing (for neither is it a thing that depends of our own will,\nnor of itself contrary to the common good) and generally, as it is both\nexpedient and seasonable to the whole, that in that respect it must\nneeds be good. It is that also, which is brought unto us by the order\nand appointment of the Divine Providence; so that he whose will and\nmind in these things runs along with the Divine ordinance, and by this\nconcurrence of his will and mind with the Divine Providence, is led\nand driven along, as it were by God Himself; may truly be termed and\nesteemed the *OEo~p7poc*, or divinely led and inspired."
