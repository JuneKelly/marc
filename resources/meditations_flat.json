No one could ever say of him that\nhe was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant;\nbut every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery,\nable to manage his own and other men's affairs.\n\nBesides this, he honoured\nthose who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who\npretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He\nwas also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without\nany offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body's\nhealth, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard\nto personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through\nhis own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician's\nart or of medicine or external applications.\n\nHe was most ready to\ngive way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty,\nsuch as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or\nof anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy\nreputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably\nto the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation\nof doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but\nhe loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the\nsame things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately\nfresh and vigorous to his usual occupations.\n\nHis secrets were not\nbut very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and\nhe showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles\nand the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people,\nand in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be\ndone, not to the reputation which is got by a man's acts. He did not\ntake the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses,\nnor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of\nhis clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves.\n\nHis dress came from\nLorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know\nhow he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon;\nand such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor\nimplacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to\nthe sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he\nhad abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously\nand consistently.\n\nAnd that might be applied to him which is recorded\nof Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy,\nthose things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy\nwithout excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to\nbe sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible\nsoul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus."

For instance, when bread is baked some parts are split\nat the surface, and these parts which thus open, and have a certain\nfashion contrary to the purpose of the baker's art, are beautiful\nin a manner, and in a peculiar way excite a desire for eating. And\nagain, figs, when they are quite ripe, gape open; and in the ripe\nolives the very circumstance of their being near to rottenness adds\na peculiar beauty to the fruit.\n\nAnd the ears of corn bending down,\nand the lion's eyebrows, and the foam which flows from the mouth of\nwild boars, and many other things- though they are far from being\nbeautiful, if a man should examine them severally- still, because\nthey are consequent upon the things which are formed by nature, help\nto adorn them, and they please the mind; so that if a man should have\na feeling and deeper insight with respect to the things which are\nproduced in the universe, there is hardly one of those which follow\nby way of consequence which will not seem to him to be in a manner\ndisposed so as to give pleasure.\n\nAnd so he will see even the real\ngaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than those which\npainters and sculptors show by imitation; and in an old woman and\nan old man he will be able to see a certain maturity and comeliness;\nand the attractive loveliness of young persons he will be able to\nlook on with chaste eyes; and many such things will present themselves,\nnot pleasing to every man, but to him only who has become truly familiar\nwith nature and her works."

Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that\nrational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part\nof justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how\nmany already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting,\nhave been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.\nBut perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee\nout of the universe.

See how soon everything\nis forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side\nof the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness\nand want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the\nnarrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet\nat last.

But among the things readiest to thy hand to which thou shalt\nturn, let there be these, which are two. One is that things do not\ntouch the soul, for they are external and remain immovable; but our\nperturbations come only from the opinion which is within.

For since the universal nature\nhas made rational animals for the sake of one another to help one\nanother according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another,\nhe who transgresses her will, is clearly guilty of impiety towards\nthe highest divinity.\n\nAnd he too who lies is guilty of impiety to\nthe same divinity; for the universal nature is the nature of things\nthat are; and things that are have a relation to all things that come\ninto existence. And further, this universal nature is named truth,\nand is the prime cause of all things that are true. He then who lies\nintentionally is guilty of impiety inasmuch as he acts unjustly by\ndeceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is\nat variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs\nthe order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights\nagainst it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth,\nfor he had received powers from nature through the neglect of which\nhe is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth.\n\nAnd indeed\nhe who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty\nof impiety. For of necessity such a man must often find fault with\nthe universal nature, alleging that it assigns things to the bad and\nthe good contrary to their deserts, because frequently the bad are\nin the enjoyment of pleasure and possess the things which procure\npleasure, but the good have pain for their share and the things which\ncause pain. And further, he who is afraid of pain will sometimes also\nbe afraid of some of the things which will happen in the world, and\neven this is impiety. And he who pursues pleasure will not abstain\nfrom injustice, and this is plainly impiety. Now with respect to the\nthings towards which the universal nature is equally affected- for\nit would not have made both, unless it was equally affected towards\nboth- towards these they who wish to follow nature should be of the\nsame mind with it, and equally affected.\n\nWith respect to pain, then,\nand pleasure, or death and life, or honour and dishonour, which the\nuniversal nature employs equally, whoever is not equally affected\nis manifestly acting impiously.\n\nAnd I say that the universal nature\nemploys them equally, instead of saying that they happen alike to\nthose who are produced in continuous series and to those who come\nafter them by virtue of a certain original movement of Providence,\naccording to which it moved from a certain beginning to this ordering\nof things, having conceived certain principles of the things which\nwere to be, and having determined powers productive of beings and\nof changes and of such like successions."

Accordingly among animals\ndevoid of reason we find swarms of bees, and herds of cattle, and\nthe nurture of young birds, and in a manner, loves; for even in animals\nthere are souls, and that power which brings them together is seen\nto exert itself in the superior degree, and in such a way as never\nhas been observed in plants nor in stones nor in trees.

Thus\nthe ascent to the higher degree is able to produce a sympathy even\nin things which are separated.\n\nSee, then, what now takes place.

For at the same time that thou dost remind\nthyself that it is impossible that such kind of men should not exist,\nthou wilt become more kindly disposed towards every one individually.\n\nIt is useful to perceive this, too, immediately when the occasion\narises, what virtue nature has given to man to oppose to every wrongful\nact. For she has given to man, as an antidote against the stupid man,\nmildness, and against another kind of man some other power. And in\nall cases it is possible for thee to correct by teaching the man who\nis gone astray; for every man who errs misses his object and is gone\nastray.\n\nBesides wherein hast thou been injured? For thou wilt find\nthat no one among those against whom thou art irritated has done anything\nby which thy mind could be made worse; but that which is evil to thee\nand harmful has its foundation only in the mind. And what harm is\ndone or what is there strange, if the man who has not been instructed\ndoes the acts of an uninstructed man? Consider whether thou shouldst\nnot rather blame thyself, because thou didst not expect such a man\nto err in such a way. For thou hadst means given thee by thy reason\nto suppose that it was likely that he would commit this error, and\nyet thou hast forgotten and art amazed that he has erred. But most\nof all when thou blamest a man as faithless or ungrateful, turn to\nthyself.\n\nFor the fault is manifestly thy own, whether thou didst trust\nthat a man who had such a disposition would keep his promise, or when\nconferring thy kindness thou didst not confer it absolutely, nor yet\nin such way as to have received from thy very act all the profit.\nFor what more dost thou want when thou hast done a man a service?\nArt thou not content that thou hast done something conformable to\nthy nature, and dost thou seek to be paid for it? Just as if the eye\ndemanded a recompense for seeing, or the feet for walking.\n\nFor as\nthese members are formed for a particular purpose, and by working\naccording to their several constitutions obtain what is their own;\nso also as man is formed by nature to acts of benevolence, when he\nhas done anything benevolent or in any other way conducive to the\ncommon interest, he has acted conformably to his constitution, and\nhe gets what is his own."

For whatever this may be, it\nis in thy power to do it or to say it, and do not make excuses that\nthou art hindered. Thou wilt not cease to lament till thy mind is\nin such a condition that, what luxury is to those who enjoy pleasure,\nsuch shall be to thee, in the matter which is subjected and presented\nto thee, the doing of the things which are conformable to man's constitution;\nfor a man ought to consider as an enjoyment everything which it is\nin his power to do according to his own nature. And it is in his power\neverywhere.\n\nNow, it is not given to a cylinder to move everywhere\nby its own motion, nor yet to water nor to fire, nor to anything else\nwhich is governed by nature or an irrational soul, for the things\nwhich check them and stand in the way are many. But intelligence and\nreason are able to go through everything that opposes them, and in\nsuch manner as they are formed by nature and as they choose.\n\nPlace\nbefore thy eyes this facility with which the reason will be carried\nthrough all things, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder\ndown an inclined surface, and seek for nothing further. For all other\nobstacles either affect the body only which is a dead thing; or, except\nthrough opinion and the yielding of the reason itself, they do not\ncrush nor do any harm of any kind; for if they did, he who felt it\nwould immediately become bad.\n\nNow, in the case of all things which\nhave a certain constitution, whatever harm may happen to any of them,\nthat which is so affected becomes consequently worse; but in the like\ncase, a man becomes both better, if one may say so, and more worthy\nof praise by making a right use of these accidents. And finally remember\nthat nothing harms him who is really a citizen, which does not harm\nthe state; nor yet does anything harm the state, which does not harm\nlaw (order); and of these things which are called misfortunes not\none harms law. What then does not harm law does not harm either state\nor citizen."

But examine the matter from first principles, from\nthis: If all things are not mere atoms, it is nature which orders\nall things: if this is so, the inferior things exist for the sake\nof the superior, and these for the sake of one another.\n\nSecond, consider what kind of men they are at table, in bed, and so\nforth: and particularly, under what compulsions in respect of opinions\nthey are; and as to their acts, consider with what pride they do what\nthey do.\n\nThird, that if men do rightly what they do, we ought not to be displeased;\nbut if they do not right, it is plain that they do so involuntarily\nand in ignorance. For as every soul is unwillingly deprived of the\ntruth, so also is it unwillingly deprived of the power of behaving\nto each man according to his deserts.

Take away these opinions then, and resolve\nto dismiss thy judgement about an act as if it were something grievous,\nand thy anger is gone. How then shall I take away these opinions?\nBy reflecting that no wrongful act of another brings shame on thee:\nfor unless that which is shameful is alone bad, thou also must of\nnecessity do many things wrong, and become a robber and everything\nelse.\n\nEighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger\nand vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which\nwe are angry and vexed.\n\nNinth, consider that a good disposition is invincible, if it be genuine,\nand not an affected smile and acting a part. For what will the most\nviolent man do to thee, if thou continuest to be of a kind disposition\ntowards him, and if, as opportunity offers, thou gently admonishest\nhim and calmly correctest his errors at the very time when he is trying\nto do thee harm, saying, \"Not so, my child: we are constituted by nature\nfor something else: I shall certainly not be injured, but thou art\ninjuring thyself, my child.\" And show him with gentle tact and by\ngeneral principles that this is so, and that even bees do not do as\nhe does, nor any animals which are formed by nature to be gregarious.\nAnd thou must do this neither with any double meaning nor in the way\nof reproach, but affectionately and without any rancour in thy soul;\nand not as if thou wert lecturing him, nor yet that any bystander\nmay admire, but either when he is alone, and if others are present..."
